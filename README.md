# Custom Story Generator

This program allows users to create their own interactive stories by choosing specific words to fill in placeholders in pre-defined stories. It offers multiple story options for the user to choose from, and once a story is selected, the program will guide the user through providing the words that will complete the story.

## Features
- Interactive prompts for filling in story placeholders (e.g., adjectives, verbs, animals, etc.).
- Easy to add more stories by editing the `stories` dictionary in the code.

## How to Use

1. **Run the program**: Simply execute the `custom_story.py` file in your Python environment.
2. **Choose a story**: The program will prompt you to select one of the stories by typing its corresponding number.
3. **Fill in the blanks**: The program will ask for different types of words (e.g., adjectives, verbs, places, etc.) to fill in the story. Prompts will help you understand what kind of word to provide.
4. **Read the story**: After providing all the words, the program will display your custom story with your chosen words in place of the placeholders.
